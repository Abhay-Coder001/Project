__Objective__ 

This app will work same as our windows commands do like shutdown,logout,restart and after some time restart. The main objective here to create a simple GUI based app where we are interacting with os with the help of tkinter and os module.

__Required Modules__

__(b)__ os module : This will help GUI to interact with os


__What we do ?__

__Step 1 :__ First import both modules. After that first we create tab using tkinter. We call tkinter function "tk" then make a object for it. The object name Command.

__Step 2 :__ Then for menu bar use 'Menu' and for title use 'title' 

__Step 3 :__ Then set the tab size for that purpose use geometry.

__Step 4 :__ Then create 4 buttons using Button method.
