# Convert .py into exe

### Why we want it ?
Suppose if we want to share our python project to someone who don't have python installed in his/her device.. in that scenario we will give them an exe file.

### How it will happen ?
First we install pyinstaller module in directory of that file which we want to convert into exe.

After that we run command : 
python -m pyinstaller <file name>.py

That's it.
