The magic

The magic of this project lies on modifying the host file within your 
computer that manages how you access the web.


Adding sites to block + Editing host files

Now open the *app.py* and then go to line 4 with variable *site_to_block*
and you can add the sites you would like to block during work time

One more thing 
-------------------

You would need to set up the starting working + ending working hours where you would like to be restricted from accessing those websites.
To do this go to line last line of our code and edit the hours where by.
