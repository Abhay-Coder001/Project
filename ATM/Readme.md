# ATM Machine

### Required Modules

1. time module : We use this module just to look whole process like a real ATM do.

<br />

### Approch
First we make a tuple of pin variable and put a pin in it. If true than go for..

We give user 4 options. <br />
1. for checking the balance
2. for making cash withdrawl
3. for pay in the cash 
4. return the card

All these options are usually present in ATM Macines. Then for each option we write some code how it will respond to user request.

1. Option 1 : Just create a variable and put some number in it. and print it.

2. Option 2 : Whatever user enters take it in a variable and then (balance = balance - variable) do this for new balance.

3. Option 3 : Make a variable to store user entered value. then (balance = balance + variable) do this for new balance.

4. Option 4 : Just print "Please wait while we are discarding your card."

and if not than "Incorrect Password" make a chance variable and set limit how many time user can enter password.
