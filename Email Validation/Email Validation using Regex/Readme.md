# Email Validation using Regex

## Regex

Regex is the module Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters. Most ordinary characters, like "A", "a", or "0", are the simplest regular expressions; they simply match themselves. You can concatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last'.

<br />

## Requirements

1. re module
2. if-else

<br />

## Method

We first import __re__ module then we go for a regular module then give all the regular expression(in regular expression you give all the required conditions) and then pass it to a variable. Then take input email from the user then compare it to the variable. Then if 

(a) variable == user_email

Then it is a __Valid Email__ else print it is __Invalid Email__.

<br />

## Conclusion

Apply this method we get our output as valid or invalid email. The issue here that it is little bit difficult to put more conditions to make it precise but definetly it takes less lines of codes.
