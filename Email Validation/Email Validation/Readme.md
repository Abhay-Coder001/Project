# Email Validation

**Email Validation :** The process where we check wheather a inputed email is valid or not. 

For check email validation we need to check some conditions.

If any email satisfy all the conditions we can call it a valid email.

<br />


## Conditions :
    1. Minimum length of the email is 6.

    2. The first letter of email must be a smallcase character.
    
    3. One '@' must be present in email.
    
    4. '.' must be present in the email in 3rd or 4th position.
    
    5. No wide space allow in email and all the characters in email must be in lowercase.

<br />

## Method

We go one by one condition. First we put one condition in if statement then else we say wrong email.Then we create one more if statement and give the condition to it and in else we say wrong email and so on..

We do all these things in the form of nested loop so the time complexity will be minimum.

At last when all the conditions are satisfied we print **Valid Email** in output.




<br />

## Conclusion

We make a program were we check all the conditions and give output wheather a email is correct or not.
