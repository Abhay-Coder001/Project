# Task Scedular










## Module Required
* `datetime`
* `time`
* `schedule`


## Methadology 

The basic idea is that we have python script running all the time and then we have certain tasks or functions we want to execute on a regular basis it can be everyday,everyminute,everysecond,everyday at a certain time. All of this is easy using `schedule` module. All of this is related to time so we use one more module `datetime`
